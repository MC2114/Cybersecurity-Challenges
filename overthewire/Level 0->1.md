## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Approach
Use the command <code>ls</code> to see all of the files in the home directory. Look into the <code>readme</code> file using <code>cat</code>

## Solution
```zsh
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
