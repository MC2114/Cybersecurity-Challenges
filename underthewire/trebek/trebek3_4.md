## Level Goal
The password for trebek4 is the IP that the user Yoda last logged in from as depicted in the event logs on the desktop PLUS the name of the text file on the userâ€™s desktop.

## Solution
Once again, we would use the cmdlet <code>Get-WinEvent</code> to find the event log we want. From the initial output based purely on filtering the message, I know that the Event ID (out of the 2 options listed <code>4624</code> and <code>4634</code>) would be <code>4624</code>.

Therefore, I filter the events again, choosing only the login and excluding the log-off messages, expanding the <code>Message</code> section for clarity. The output is INCREDIBLY long and would be counter-productive to paste them all here, so I will just include the relevant information where we get the IP address.
