## Level Goal
The password for trebek11 is the last name of the user who enabled Obi-Wan Kenobiâ€™s account as depicted in the event logs on the desktop PLUS the name of the file on the desktop.

## Solution
Once again, we use the <code>Get-WinEvent</code> to look for our target event in th event log (yay!). When we look at the initial message listed, we can see that the event ID 4722 signifies that a new user has been enabled (which is also confirmed through the Appendix). From there, we would want to take a closer look at who authorized this event.

It is easy to notice that the <code>Account Name: admiral.ackbar</code> was responsible here! And there last name was most likely <code>ackbar</code> (if the formatting of <code>ackbar</code> was anything to go by)!<br>
